# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh







Create an Exercise Component that utilizes the useSelector hook to access the state of the exercises and map to display each exercise 

Add a form to the page that allow users to add exercises. Use the useDispatch hook to dispatch the addExercise action to your store.

Add a button to each displayed exercise that allows users to delete the exercise from the store.
